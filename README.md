# Enable_spatial_awareness

Equinor's vision is to enable the spatial awareness of data and thereby allow spatial discovery and advanced spatial data analytics. As a first step, Equinor has started the SLIMM project during 2020, which is classified as open project. SLIMM stand for Spatial Location Information and Media files and aims to capture the spatial awareness of media and sensor data to make it discoverable in space and time and thus, enable new ways of data driven operations and execution.
 
We are working towards a standardization of spatial data deliveries to Equinor. Furthermore, we ingest acquired data as well as stream data to be stored as well as indexed with a spatial reference. Finally, we make the data discoverable in space and time through APIs. This will ultimately allow any data consumer, be it a field worker, a robot, or an analytical tool, to retrieve data related to any point in space at any point in time.

In order to achieve the above, our team is working on several tasks: 
- Increasing the awareness of spatial data inside the company,
- Standardization of data deliveries containing spatial components,
- Platform development in MSFT Azure as displayed in building block diagram.
